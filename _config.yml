          • An **information-theoretic probe** is designed to understand how language models encode commonsense knowledge by estimating the mutual information between commonsense knowledge graph and word representation from the language models.

          • Using different **GNN** and **Random Walk** methods to get graph embeddings and process the knowledge graph in order to get pre-trained representations

          • A paper is in preparation for submission to **TACL**.

          • **Combine symbolic rules (regular expressions, REs) and neural networks** by converting REs into bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks via finite-state transducers, enabling the neural network to generalize in zero-shot or cold-start scenarios.

          • On the **slot filling** task, our model achieves a superior zero-shot and few-shot performance while remains competitive in rich-resource settings.

          • A paper is submitted to **EMNLP 2021**.

            Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Compay is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
